# recondite_crayon

One of my first Javascript/p5.js projects my first semester at ITP 

The frame rate is controlled by pressing the mouse

The text-size gets larger over time independently of the mouse

Every time one runs the sketch both the placement of the words on the screen is different and the colors of the words are different- both at random
